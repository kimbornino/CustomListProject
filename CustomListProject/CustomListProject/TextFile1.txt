PLUS OPERATOR
------------------------------
The plus operator's override function is used to combine lists together. 
It combines the lists by creating a new list.  The new list first takes in each item in the first list.  
It then starts adding the second list at the next available index.  The lists are passed in through the parameters.  
The method's return type is a CustomList that will save to a variable the user creates. CustomList is a class that is 
different than "List," but like List, it uses an underlying framework of array, and also contains some of the same
methods and properties such as "Add" and "Remove."

This is the syntax of the override.  It is being instantiated in a class called CustomList. 
 
public static CustomList<T> operator +(CustomList<T> x, CustomList<T> y)
        {
            CustomList<T> tempList = new CustomList<T>();
            int firstListCount = tempList.Count;

            for (int i = 0; i < x.Count; i++)
            {
                tempList.Add(x[i]);
            }
            for (int i = 0; i < y.Count; i++)
            {
                tempList.Add(y[i]);

            }

            return tempList;
        }
 Here is an example of the function being called to take in two Customlists:
 
  [TestMethod]
        public void Plus_CheckIndexZero()
        {
            CustomList<int> first = new CustomList<int>();
            first.Add(1);
            first.Add(2);
            first.Add(3);

            CustomList<int> second = new CustomList<int>();
            second.Add(4);
            second.Add(5);
            second.Add(6);

            CustomList<int> result = new CustomList<int>();
            int expectedResult = 1;

            result = first + second;

			//expected output {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,}

MINUS OPERATOR
---------------------
The minus operator's override function is used to subtract items in a second list FROM the first list.
It takes two paremeters.  (<T> Item to Subtract from, <> Item to subtract).  The returned array will be a modified
form if the list passed into the first parameter.  Under the hood, the program is building a new list that will be 
reassigned to the variable name of the first list.

This the synatax of the override.  It is being instantiated in a class called CustomList. 

 public static CustomList<T> operator -(CustomList<T> x, CustomList<T> y)
        {
            //CustomList<T> tempList = new CustomList<T>();

            for (int i = 0; i < x.Count; i++)
            {
                for (int j = 0; j < y.Count; j++)
                {
                    if (x[i].Equals(y[j]))
                    {
                        x.Remove(x[i]);
                        
                    }
                }               
            }
            return x;
        }
Here is an example of the function being used to subtract values from a list passed in through the parameter.

        {
            CustomList<int> first = new CustomList<int>();
            first.Add(1);
            first.Add(2);
            first.Add(3);

            CustomList<int> second = new CustomList<int>();
            second.Add(4);
            second.Add(1);
            second.Add(6);

            CustomList<int> result = new CustomList<int>();
            int expectedResult = 2;

            result = first - second; // {2,3}
